# Aggregate Bars (OHLC)

## 源URL

https://massive.com/docs/rest/futures/aggregates

## 描述

Retrieve aggregated historical OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) and volume data for a specified futures contract ticker over a custom date range and time interval in Central Time (CT). Aggregates are constructed from all trades during the period. If no trades occur within a given timeframe, no aggregate bar is produced, indicating a period of inactivity. Users can tailor their data by adjusting the multiplier and timespan parameters (e.g., a 5-minute bar), supporting a wide range of analytical and visualization needs.

## 参数

| 参数名称 | 类型 | 必选 | 说明 |
| -------- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| ticker | string | 否 | The futures contract identifier, including the base symbol and contract expiration (e.g., GCJ5 for the April 2025 gold contract). |
| resolution | string | 否 | This sets the size of the aggregate windows. It accepts custom values that specify the granularity and the duration of the window.<br>For example: 15mins, 30secs, 12hours, or 7days.<br>There are maximum allowable candle sizes. For example, you can request "1min" to "59mins", but after that you will need to use "1hr". If you make a request for a candle size that is not supported, we will return a 400 "Bad Request - resolution value is not allowed." |
| window_start | string | 否 | Specifies the start time of the aggregate (OHLC) candles you want returned (YYYY-MM-DD date or nanosecond Unix timestamp).<br>How it works - If not provided, the API returns the most recent candles available, up to the limit you set. - If provided, the value determines which candle(s) to return. The timestamp or date is “snapped” to the start time of the matching candle interval. - You can use comparison operators to form ranges:<br>  - `window_start.gte` – greater than or equal to<br>  - `window_start.gt` – greater than<br>  - `window_start.lte` – less than or equal to<br>  - `window_start.lt` – less thanExamples 1. Most recent minute candles<br>   `/vX/aggs/ESU5?resolution=1min&limit=5`2. Daily candle for August 5, 2025<br>   `/vX/aggs/ESU5?resolution=1day&window_start=2025-08-05`3. Daily candles from July 1–31, 2025<br>   `/vX/aggs/ESU5?resolution=1day&window_start.gte=2025-07-01&window_start.lte=2025-07-31`4. 1,000 one-second candles after a specific timestamp<br>   `/vX/aggs/ESU5?resolution=1sec&window_start.gt=1751409877000000000&limit=1000` |
| limit | integer | 否 | The number of results to return per page (default=1000, maximum=50000, minimum=1). |
| sort | enum (string) | 否 | Sort results by field and direction using dotted notation (e.g., 'ticker.asc', 'name.desc'). |
