Market Hours and Timezone

Data for U.S. options primarily aligns with regular market hours:

Regular Market Hours: Monday through Friday, 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time (ET)

While some exchanges may offer limited trading outside of these hours, options activity predominantly occurs during regular sessions. All timestamps in the datasets are provided as Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch, UTC). When converting these timestamps into human-readable form (e.g., market open at 9:30 AM), remember they represent UTC time, not Eastern Time (ET). To correctly align data with market hours or dates, you'll need to explicitly convert timestamps from UTC to ET during your analysis.

Infrastructure and Reliability

Our robust infrastructure begins at the core of the U.S. options market: the Options Price Reporting Authority (OPRA). By co-locating with OPRA and maintaining direct connections to all U.S. options exchanges, we minimize latency and maximize data integrity. Each trading day, we process and store approximately 3 terabytes of options data, supported by advanced, scalable data handling systems designed for the market's high throughput and complexity. This reliable infrastructure ensures timely and accurate market information, maintaining the highest standards of speed, resilience, and compliance.

Data Flow: From Exchanges to You

Our options data originates from all 17 U.S. options exchanges, capturing every quote and trade across the market. Exchanges provide their data to OPRA, which consolidates it into a single feed containing the official National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) and trade information.

By connecting directly to OPRA, we deliver a unified and comprehensive view of the entire U.S. options landscape, covering equities, ETFs, indices, and currencies, with futures options coming soon.

The U.S. options market includes:

NYSE American Options
Boston Options Exchange (BOX)
Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)
Cboe EDGX Options
Cboe C2 Options
Cboe BZX Options
Nasdaq Options Market (NOM)
Nasdaq PHLX
Nasdaq BX Options
Nasdaq ISE
Nasdaq GEMX
Nasdaq MRX
MIAX Emerald
MIAX Pearl Options

MEMX Options

By aggregating data from these exchanges, OPRA ensures that all market participants have equal access to consolidated market data. Our direct connection to OPRA allows us to deliver timely, accurate data that supports market transparency and informed decision-making.

What are Securities Information Processors (SIPs)?

In the options market, OPRA functions similarly to Securities Information Processors (SIPs) in the equities markets. OPRA consolidates trade and quote data from all participating options exchanges and distributes this standardized information to market participants. This process ensures equal access to official NBBO and last sale data, upholding market transparency and fairness.

Our integration with OPRA ensures that you receive comprehensive and timely options market data, enabling effective strategies, analyses, and application development.

Regulatory Compliance

We adhere to all regulatory requirements governing the distribution of U.S. options market data. Through strict compliance with exchange licensing agreements and OPRA policies, we ensure that both non-professional and professional users can access data within the appropriate guidelines. For business clients, we offer tailored plans that accommodate various licensing requirements, providing the flexibility needed to serve a wide range of professional trading environments while maintaining data integrity and legality.
