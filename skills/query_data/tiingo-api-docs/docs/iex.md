## 描述

Our IEX Exchange API has two kinds of avenues for (1) Customers who are officially registered with the exchange and (2) Customers who want a simple, compliant solution, but do not want to formally register with the exchange.

1. Tiingo has a cross-correct directly to the IEX Exchange that gives us access to raw binary price feeds we can share with you all. We receive IEX TOPS (top of book), which means we get the last sale data AND top bid and ask quotes.

2. For customers that don't want to register with the exchange to receive full TOPS, you may use our derived reference price feed which provides a real-time reference price for the asset - giving you the benefit of a real-time feed without the added compliance or exchange fees required.

Benefits of Tiingo + IEX

As of February 1st, 2025 IEX Exchange has changed their market data policies. To receive the FULL TOPS Feed, you must now have a market data agreement signed with the IEX Exchange. Upon signing, you will then be able to receive the full TOPS feed in real-time.

For customers who do not want to sign a license agreement, you may use our derived data that calculates a reference price for each asset in real-time. While this is not a subsitute for the TOPS Feed, we do believe it will fulfill the needs of 95% of our customer base. There is no additional cost to the IEX Exchange if using our derived data.

You can find out about the full product offering on the Product - IEX page.

- 14,000+ tickers IEX provides quotes and trade data on.
- Data includes Top-of-Book (Bid/Ask) and Last Sale (trade) Data.
- Data now includes intraday OHLC bar historical data for all your needs.
- Tiingo enriches the data, giving you more data for your convenience.
- Quotes updated to the latest nanosecond.
- Access to every field IEX gives us access to (including trade flags).
- Data is served via a REST API & Websocket API.

## 2.5.2 Current Top-of-Book & Last Price

"IEX Entitlement Required" means the value will be null unless you are registered with the IEX Exchange and have a market data policy in place.

| Field Name | JSON Field | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ticker | ticker | string | Ticker related to the asset. |
| Timestamp | timestamp | datetime | The timestamp the data was last refresh on. |
| Quote Timestamp | quoteTimestamp | datetime | The timestamp the last time the quote (bid/ask) data was received from IEX. IEX entitlement required |
| Last Sale Timestamp | lastSaleTimestamp | datetime | The timestamp the last time the trade (last/lastSize) data was received from IEX. IEX entitlement required |
| last | last | float | Last is the last trade that was executed on IEX. IEX entitlement required |
| Last Size | lastSize | int32 | The amount of shares traded (volume) at the last price on IEX.  IEX entitlement required |
| Tiingo Last | tngoLast | float | Tiingo Last is either the last price or mid price. The mid price is only used if our algo determines
                 it is a good proxy for the last price. So if the spread is considered wide by our algo, we do not use it.
                 Also, after the official exchange print comes in, this value changes to that value.
                This value is calculated by Tiingo and not provided by IEX. |
| Previous Close | prevClose | float | Previous day's closing price of the security.This can be from any of the exchanges, NYSE, NASDAQ, IEX, etc. |
| Open | open | float | The opening price of the asset on the current day
                 This value is calculated by Tiingo and not provided by IEX. |
| High | high | float | The high price of the asset on the current day
                 This value is calculated by Tiingo and not provided by IEX. |
| Low | low | float | The low price of the asset on the current day
                 This value is calculated by Tiingo and not provided by IEX. |
| Mid | mid | float | The mid price of the current timestamp when both "bidPrice" and "askPrice" are not-null.
In mathematical terms:
        
mid = (bidPrice + askPrice)/2.0

                 This value is calculated by Tiingo and not provided by IEX. |
| Volume | volume | int64 | Volume will be IEX Volume throughout the day, but once the official closing price comes in, volume will             reflect the volume done on the entire day across all exchanges. This field is available for convenience. |
| Bid Size | bidSize | float | The amount of shares at the bid price.  IEX entitlement required |
| Bid Price | bidPrice | float | The current bid price.  IEX entitlement required |
| Ask Size | askSize | float | The amount of shares at the ask price.  IEX entitlement required |
