- Data is covered daily, quarterly, and for annual statements.
- Data is structured and normalized across a pre-define set of tickers for easy backtests and analysis.
- Data is served via a REST API API.
- Data is updated usually within 12-24 hours of being made available by the SEC.
- 3 Years of the DOW 30 tickers are available for free/evaluation.

## 2.6.2 Definitions Data

This endpoint can be used to check which the various fields available in the fundamentals endpoint. As we add more indicators, the output of this endpoint will change to reflect the addition of indicators.

| Field Name | JSON Field | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data Code | dataCode | string | An identifier representing the fundamentals field the value belongs to. For example, "peRatio." |
| Name | name | string | A human-friendly readable name of the field. |
| Description | description | string | A description of the field. |
| Statement Type | statementType | string | One of four values ("balanceSheet", "incomeStatement", "cashFlow", "overview"), representing             which statement this value belongs to. For example, "netIncome" would belong to "incomeStatement". |
| Units | units | string | The unit the field value is in. Value is either "$", "%" or blank. If blank, value may either             be an integer (like shares outstanding), or a ratio. |

## 2.6.3 Statement Data Endpoint

This endpoint returns data that is extracted from quarterly and annual statements.

For Tiingo statement data, use the endpoints below. Provide either a ticker (active symbols) or a Tiingo permaTicker (stable identifier for delisted/recycled symbols).

With this endpoint, the JSON (default) and CSV formats do share some differences in data strcture. The JSON data is nested, whereas the CSV format, by necessity, is a 2-D, flat structure. The data is the same, so choose a format that is simplest for you to digest.

Additionally, please ensure your code can handle new indicators as we will be continually updating these end points as we obtain new information and add new metrics.

To see what format of the array of fields are returned in the "statementData" field, please see the table below.

### Statement Data Field

| Field Name | JSON Field | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Date | date | datetime | The date the statement data was released to the public. |
| Quarter | quarter | int32 | An integer corresponding to the fiscal quarter reported. A value of "0" means this is an             Annual Report. A value of "1" through "4" corresponds to the respective fiscal quarter. |
| Year | year | int32 | An integer corresponding to the fiscal year reported. |
| Statement Data | statementData | object | Statement data that is broken out by four different fields in a JSON object. 
            Each fields corresponds to a statement. The four fields are: 
            
                balanceSheet:  Balance sheet data
                incomeStatement: Income Statement Data
                cashFlow: Cash flow statement data
                overview: Metrics and ratios that may be a combination of the fields from various statements
            
            Each field will return an array of "dataCode" and "value" pairs that are described in the "Statement Data Table"
            below. |

| Field Name | JSON Field | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data Code | dataCode | string | An identifier representing the fundamentals field the value belongs to. For example, "peRatio." |
| Value | value | float | The value of the field corresponding to the dataCode |

```text
# To request historical statement data, use this endpoint (ticker for active symbols)
https://api.tiingo.com/tiingo/fundamentals/<ticker>/statements

# For delisted or recycled symbols, use Tiingo permaTicker (stable identifier)
https://api.tiingo.com/tiingo/fundamentals/<permaTicker>/statements

# To request historical statement data limited by date range, use this endpoint
https://api.tiingo.com/tiingo/fundamentals/<ticker>/statements?startDate=2019-06-30
```

- balanceSheet:  Balance sheet data
- incomeStatement: Income Statement Data
- cashFlow: Cash flow statement data
- overview: Metrics and ratios that may be a combination of the fields from various statements

## 2.6.4 Daily Data

While statement data covers quarterly and annual reporting, some metrics that rely on price update daily, for example Market Capitalization, P/E Ratios, P/B Ratios, etc. This endpoint covers daily metrics.

For Tiingo daily fundamentals, use the endpoints below. Provide either a ticker (active symbols) or a Tiingo permaTicker (stable identifier for delisted/recycled symbols).

This endpoint is different than others in that the different daily metrics are "columns". Please note that we will continue to add new daily metrics, so the fields will change throughout time. We recommend you do not make parsing code that requires columns or fields to be in a particular order. If you do require this, please use the columns request parameter to ensure constant output, even if we add columns. For example, columns=marketCap,peRatio will always ensure only those two fields are returned in that exact order.

| Field Name | JSON Field | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Date | date | datetime | The date the daily data corresponds to. |
| Market Cap | marketCap | float | The value of the field corresponding to the market capitalization. |
| Enterprise Value | enterpriseVal | float | The value of the field corresponding to the enterprise value. |
| P/E Ratio | peRatio | float | The value of the field corresponding to the price/earnings ratio. |
| P/B Ratio | pbRatio | float | The value of the field corresponding to the price/book ratio. |
| Trailing PEG Ratio (1Y) | trailingPEG1Y | float | The value of the field corresponding to the trailing 1 year PEG Ratio. |

```text
# To request daily metric data, use this endpoint (ticker for active symbols)
https://api.tiingo.com/tiingo/fundamentals/<ticker>/daily

# For delisted or recycled symbols, use Tiingo permaTicker (stable identifier)
https://api.tiingo.com/tiingo/fundamentals/<permaTicker>/daily
```

## 2.6.5 Meta Data

This endpoint can be used to check which tickers have been updated with new fundamental data.

Like the endpoints above, as we add new meta data about companies and their fundamentals, this endpoint will change output. Please do not code with the assumption that column orders will always be maintained. If you must, please pass the columns parameter to ensure the output maintains its column order. For example, columns=ticker,name will always ensure those columns are returned in that exact order.

| Field Name | JSON Field | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Perma Ticker | permaTicker | string | Permanent Tiingo Ticker mapping to the security. Can be used as a primary key. |
| Ticker | ticker | string | Ticker related to the asset. |
| Name | name | string | Full-length name of the asset. |
| Is Active | isActive | boolean | Boolean describing whether or not the ticker is still actively traded. If false, this ticker is delisted. |
| Is ADR | isADR | boolean | Boolean describing whether or not the ticker is an ADR. Value is true if listed ticker is an ADR. |
| Sector | sector | string | Sector information that is derived from sicSector and is meant to approximate GICS. |
| Industry | industry | string | Sector information that is derived from sicIndustry and is meant to approximate GICS. |
| SIC Code | sicCode | int32 | SIC Code that represents company's business activities. |
| SIC Sector | sicSector | string | Sector as determined by the SIC Code. |
| SIC Industry | sicIndustry | string | Industry as determined by the SIC Code. |

| Company Website | companyWebsite | string | The website of the company when available. |
| SEC Filing Website | secFilingWebsite | string | A URL to where you can find the company's SEC filings directly on the SEC website. |
| Statement Last Updated | statementLastUpdated | datetime | The timestamp the statement data/endpoint was last updated for the ticker. |

## 2.6.6 Additional Information & FAQ

We decided to partner with this data provider as over the years we have found their data process to be incredibly rigorous, their mission aligned with ours, and their support incredibly responsive. We hope the follow FAQ will be helpful to you, if you have any more questions please E-mail us at Support@tiingo.com

Data collection goes through a mixture of machine curation and human oversight.

Also sourcing includes the following docs: 10-12, S-11, S-4, 10SB and A-1 (Domestic), 20-F and 20FR (ADR), 40-F and 40FR (Canadian), F-1, F-10 and F-4 (ADR and Canadian), and limited 6-K (for ADR and Canadian). 8-K is being considered as well, and more others may be added in the future.

We have found XBRL unreliable and so do not rely on it. Human readable documents are a better measure of what companies intend to convey and so we focus on interpreting these.

Prior period data is pulled from the latest report for the Most-Recent (asReported=false) dimension, current period is taken only for As-Reported (asReported=true) dimension.

Our big focus is on reconciling to the underlying human readable SEC document. In addition we deploy a variety of human and algorithmic checks.

Less than 24 hours from the SEC form 10 filing.

All values are returned in USD. If a company reports in a different currency, the values are converted to USD using a time-appropriate FX-rate before being served to you via the API. This is especially relevant to ADRs who often report in a different currency than USD.
