## 描述

Tiingo's End-of-Day prices use a proprietary error checking framework to help clean data feeds and also help catch missing corportate actions (splits, dividends, and exchange listing changes). Most US Equity prices are available at 5:30 PM EST, however exchanges may send corrections until 8 PM EST. As we obtain corrections, we update prices throughout the evening.

Mutual Fund NAVs are available after 12 AM EST. The fields "open", "high", "low", "close" will contain the NAV value for the given day.

Both raw prices and adjusted prices are available. The adjustment methodology follows the standard method set forth by "The Center for Research in Security Prices" (CRSP) in this document: CRSP Calculations. This methodology incorporates both split and dividend adjustments.

You can find out about the full product offering on the Product - End-of-Day page.

### 2.1.1 Overview - Tab 内容

#### Request

| Field Name | Parameter | JSON Field | Data Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ticker | URL | N/A | string | Y | Ticker related to the asset. |
| Start Date | GET | startDate | date | N | If startDate or endDate is not null, historical data will be queried. This filter limits             metrics to on or after the startDate (>=). Parameter must be in YYYY-MM-DD format. |
| End Date | GET | endDate | date | N | If startDate or endDate is not null, historical data will be queried.             This filter limits metrics to on or before the endDate (<=). Parameter must be in YYYY-MM-DD format. |
| Resample Freq | GET | resampleFreq | string | N | Allows resampled values that allow you to choose the values returned as daily, weekly, monthly, or annually values.
            Note: ONLY DAILY takes into account holidays. All others use standard business days
Acceptable values:

    daily: Values returned as daily periods, with a holiday calendar.
    weekly: Values returned as weekly data, with days ending on Friday.
    monthly: Values returned as monthly data, with days ending on the last standard business day (Mon-Fri) of each month.
    annually: Values returned as annual data, with days ending on the last standard business day (Mon-Fri) of each year.

Note, that if you choose a value in-between the resample period for weekly, monthly, and daily, the start date rolls
 back to consider the entire period. For example, if you choose to resample weekly, but your "startDate" parameter is
 set to Wednesday of that week, the startDate will be adjusted to Monday, so the entire week is captured. Another example
 is if you send a startDate mid-month, we roll back the startDate to the beginning of the month.

Similarly, if you provide an endDate, and it's midway through the period, we roll-forward the date to capture the
 whole period. In the above example, if the end date is set to a wednesday with a weekly resample, the end date is
 rolled forward to the Friday of that week. |
| Sort | GET | sort | string | N | This field allows you to specify the sort direct and which column to sort by. Prepend "-"             if you want descending order, otherwise it will be ascending. E.g. sort=date will sort by date in             ascending order. sort=-date will sort by date in descending order. |
| Response Format | GET | format | string | N | Sets the response format of the returned data. Acceptable values are "csv" and "json". Defaults to JSON. |
| Columns | GET | columns | string[] | N | Allows you to specify which columns you would like returned from the output. Pass an array of strings of column names to get only this columns back. |
